# StockPortfolio
In this project, I use the S&amp;P500 index and along with its constituent stocks. I cluster the stocks based on the average return and volatility and apply Principal component analysis and compare the first principal component PC1 with the S&amp;P500 index. I look how well PC1 tracks the index 5 and based on PC1, I try to form a winning portfolio.
